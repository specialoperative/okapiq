# üß† Fragment Finder Agent (Rollup Opportunity Engine)

A sophisticated AI-powered system that analyzes market fragmentation, calculates HHI (Herfindahl-Hirschman Index), and identifies consolidation opportunities in local markets.

## üéØ Overview

The Fragment Finder Agent helps investors and entrepreneurs identify promising rollup opportunities by:

- **Market Analysis**: Computes market concentration using HHI and other fragmentation metrics
- **Business Intelligence**: Scrapes and analyzes data from Yelp, Google My Business, and BBB
- **Chaos Detection**: Uses NLP and entropy measures to identify unpredictable market structures
- **Target Identification**: Ranks acquisition targets by exit risk, strategic value, and complexity
- **Financial Modeling**: Projects acquisition costs, synergies, and ROI for consolidation plays

## üöÄ Features

### Core Analytics Engine

- **HHI Calculation**: Measures market concentration (0-10000 scale)
- **Mom-and-Pop Density**: Identifies markets with high small business density
- **Entropy Metrics**: Detects market chaos and volatility patterns
- **Geographic Dispersion**: Analyzes spatial distribution of businesses
- **Temporal Instability**: Measures business age distribution volatility

### Chaos-Aware Design

- **NLP Review Analysis**: Identifies inconsistent pricing, service volatility, ownership changes
- **Sentiment Mismatch Detection**: Flags reviews where rating doesn't match sentiment
- **Seasonal Pattern Recognition**: Detects cyclical business patterns
- **Chaotic Actor Identification**: Finds businesses with unpredictable behavior

### Target Scoring System

- **Exit Risk Assessment**: Predicts likelihood of business sale based on owner age, performance
- **Strategic Value Calculation**: Measures acquisition attractiveness
- **Complexity Scoring**: Estimates acquisition difficulty and integration challenges
- **Financial Projections**: Calculates acquisition costs, synergies, and payback periods

## üìä API Usage

### Basic Analysis

const agent = new FragmentFinderAgent();

const analysis = await agent.analyzeFragmentation('90210', 'restaurants', {
  includeEntropy: true,
  maxBusinesses: 200,
  includeNLPAnalysis: true
});

console.log(`Consolidation Score: ${analysis.adjustedConsolidationScore}`);
console.log(`Top Target: ${analysis.topTargets[0].name}`);
```

## üìà Interpretation Guide

### Consolidation Scores

- **70+ (Excellent)**: Highly fragmented market with strong acquisition targets
- **50-69 (Good)**: Moderate fragmentation with viable consolidation opportunities  
- **30-49 (Moderate)**: Some consolidation potential but higher risk
- **<30 (Limited)**: Market may be too concentrated or volatile for rollups

### HHI Index Ranges

- **0-1500**: Highly competitive/fragmented market
- **1500-2500**: Moderately concentrated market
- **2500+**: Highly concentrated market

### Target Exit Risk Factors

- **Owner Age 65+**: High probability exit candidate (+40% risk score)
- **Business Age 20+**: Established but potentially ready for transition (+20%)
- **Low Performance**: Poor ratings/reviews indicate distress (+20%)
- **Small Size**: <5 employees increases exit likelihood (+10%)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ with TypeScript support
- Next.js 15+ for the web interface
- Access to business directory APIs (optional for production data)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone and install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run the demo
npx ts-node examples/fragment-finder-demo.ts

# Start the web interface
pnpm dev
```

### Configuration

The system uses simulated data by default. For production deployment:

1. **Configure API Keys**: Add Yelp Fusion API, Google Places API keys
2. **Set Rate Limits**: Adjust scraping delays in scraper services  
3. **Database Setup**: Add persistence layer for caching and historical data
4. **Industry Configs**: Customize revenue multiples and volatility factors

## üî¨ Advanced Features

### Entropy Analysis

The system calculates multiple entropy metrics:

- **Market Entropy**: Shannon entropy of revenue distribution
- **Pricing Volatility**: Coefficient of variation in estimated revenues
- **Quality Variance**: Rating distribution variance
- **Geographic Dispersion**: Spatial clustering analysis
- **Temporal Instability**: Business age distribution chaos

### NLP Chaos Detection

Reviews are analyzed for chaos indicators:

- **Pricing Inconsistency**: "overcharged", "price changed", "hidden fees"
- **Service Volatility**: "inconsistent", "hit or miss", "depends on who"
- **Ownership Changes**: "new owner", "management change", "sold business"
- **Quality Fluctuations**: "not what it used to be", "gone downhill"

### Risk Adjustments

Consolidation scores are adjusted for:

- **Industry Volatility**: Restaurants (-5%), Professional services (+5%)
- **High Chaos Actors**: >30% chaotic businesses (-10% score)
- **Market Entropy**: >80% entropy reduces score by 15%
- **Political/Seasonal Risk**: Location and industry-specific factors

## üöÄ Deployment

### Production Considerations

1. **Rate Limiting**: Implement proper delays between API calls
2. **Data Privacy**: Ensure compliance with scraping ToS and data regulations
3. **Caching**: Add Redis/database layer for expensive calculations
4. **Monitoring**: Track API quotas, processing times, and error rates
5. **Scaling**: Consider queue-based processing for large batch analyses

### Environment Variables

```bash
YELP_API_KEY=your_yelp_fusion_api_key
GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=your_google_places_api_key
BBB_API_KEY=your_bbb_api_key
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
```

## ü§ù Contributing

1. **Data Sources**: Add new business directory scrapers
2. **Industries**: Expand industry-specific analysis factors
3. **NLP Models**: Improve chaos detection algorithms
4. **UI/UX**: Enhance the React interface with new visualizations
