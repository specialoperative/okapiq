Scoring + Vectorizer - Fourth layer of the architectural diagram

This module implements the analytics and scoring layer:
[Enrichment Engine] → [Scoring + Vectorizer] ← Succession Risk, TAM, Market Clustering, 
                                               Fragmentation, Customer Spend, Potential Customers, 
                                               Growth Potential to Exit

Features:
- Advanced succession risk modeling
- TAM/SAM/SOM calculation with market clustering
- Market fragmentation analysis (HHI Index)
- Customer acquisition and spend analysis
- Growth potential and exit readiness scoring
- Vector embeddings for business similarity matching
